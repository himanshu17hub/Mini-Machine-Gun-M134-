# Mini Machine Gun M134 – CAD Project

This project showcases a high-detail 3D CAD model of the **Mini Machine Gun M134**, designed entirely in **SolidWorks**. It was developed as part of a mechanical design initiative and featured in the **Independence Day exhibition** at IIT Ropar under the **CIM Club**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The M134 Minigun is a rotary-barrel, multi-barrel machine gun used in military-grade applications. This CAD model is a scaled-down, non-functional **miniature representation** of the iconic weapon, focusing on the **mechanical structure, rotational design, and detailed aesthetics**.

This was my **second major project** in SolidWorks and a big step forward in learning multi-body part assemblies and dynamic components.

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Modeled using **SolidWorks** with accurate proportions and internal layout
- ✅ Includes key components like:
  - Rotating barrel cluster
  - Housing and external casing
  - Ammunition feed simulation (visual only)
  - Rear mounting and base
- ✅ Focused on **assembly constraints**, **rotational mechanisms**, and **circular patterns**
- ✅ Created with **future 3D printing/simulation** potential in mind

---

## 🎯 Objective

- To simulate a rotary machine gun mechanism through CAD
- To enhance skills in **multi-body design**, **assembly techniques**, and **mechanical visualization**
- To explore design approaches for **complex mechanical systems**

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Skills Used

- SolidWorks 2023
- CAD Assemblies & Mates
- Circular Pattern, Revolve, and Extrude features
- Realistic rendering (SolidWorks Visualize)
- Technical drawing creation (optional export)

## 📂 Files Included

- `/CAD/`: All part and assembly files (.SLDPRT, .SLDASM)
- `/Render/`: Final rendered images of the model
- `/Drawings/`: Optional 2D technical drawings (if created)
- `/README.md`: This documentation

---

## 📢 Showcase

This model was proudly displayed during the **Independence Day celebration at IIT Ropar**, where it caught attention for its **engineering detail and visual appeal**. The design served as a learning milestone and inspired further exploration into **product design and defense-related modeling**.
