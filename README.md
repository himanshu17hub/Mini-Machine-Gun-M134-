# Mini Machine Gun M134 – CAD Project

The Mini Machine Gun M134 is a personal CAD project modeled entirely in SolidWorks, inspired by the real-world rotary barrel system. Designed as my second major project, it focuses on detailed mechanical structure, precision assembly, and realistic aesthetics. 
I also performed motion analysis to simulate the barrel rotation, adding dynamic functionality to the model. This project was showcased during the Independence Day celebration at IIT Ropar, reflecting my passion for mechanical design, simulation, and additive manufacturing.

Showcased during the Independence Day celebration at IIT Ropar, this model reflects my passion for mechanical design and additive manufacturing, and marks a key milestone in my journey as a design enthusiast.

## 📌 Project Overview

The M134 Minigun is a rotary-barrel, multi-barrel machine gun used in military-grade applications. This CAD model is a scaled-down, non-functional **miniature representation** of the iconic weapon, focusing on the **mechanical structure, rotational design, and detailed aesthetics**.

This was my **second major project** in SolidWorks and a big step forward in learning multi-body part assemblies and dynamic components.
